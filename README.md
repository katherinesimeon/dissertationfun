# disserationfun   
  
  
This is a package of "fun" dissertation-related functions for data cleaning, documentation, and analysis. This is intended for personal/internal use for my specific dissertation project, affectionately named [fʌn.nɔlɛdʒi].
    
The package currently uses functions from dplyr & tidyr (I typically load the tidyverse when using this package).  
  
Currently, this package mainly has functions for data manipulation/cleaning that I use very often. I will be adding items for visualization and analyses soon!
